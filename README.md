# C-String
My implementation of strings in C using linked lists (because I like linked lists)

# How to use
- Methods prefixed with `string_` are constructors and should always be used when initializing a string
- Methods prefixed with `str_` act upon a initialized string and can be called directly or from their respective pointers inside the struct string (thus not needing the `str_` prefix
- What each method does is documented on the .h file
